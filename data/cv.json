  "summary": "I design and build backend systems for enterprise platforms and data-intensive business applications. For now my work focuses on management information systems, ERP-style platforms, and backend services where data integrity, performance, and long-term maintainability are critical. I’m particularly interested in software architecture, distributed systems, and event-driven platforms, and I enjoy continuously exploring how different technologies are applied in real-world systems.",
  "about": "I’m a backend engineer focused on enterprise and data-intensive business systems. Most of my work involves designing and maintaining management information systems, ERP-style platforms, and backend services where data integrity, performance, and long-term maintainability really matter. Outside of day-to-day development, I spend a lot of time studying software systems and architecture. I enjoy exploring technologies through their real-world use cases, especially in the context of distributed systems, event-driven architectures, and data-intensive platforms. I read extensively on software engineering and systems design. Some of my favorite books include Designing Data-Intensive Applications by Martin Kleppmann, Apache Kafka in Action, Designing Event-Driven Systems by Ben Stopford, and Designing Distributed Systems. I also enjoy watching conference talks from communities like NDC and Devoxx, where practitioners share lessons learned from production systems. I have experience with machine learning techniques and NLP tools, and I enjoy exploring adjacent domains when they meaningfully intersect with backend and platform engineering.",

      "description": "This is a developer tool that solves the problem of vague or unhelpful commit messages. In many teams, developers often commit multiple file changes with messages like “updated”, making it hard to track what was actually changed. This tool leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to automatically generate meaningful commit messages and pull request content based on real code changes. By doing so, it bridges the gap between developers and proper version control practices, making commit histories clearer, reviews easier, and collaboration smoother.",
